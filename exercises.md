# Exercises

After getting the app to work, try to make the following changes:

1. Add a second graph that shows the change in Median Household Income over time. Place it below the graph that shows
   total population.
1. Add a second select box that lets users select which demographic (population, income) to show. If the user selects
   "Total Population", only show the "Total Population" graph. If the user selects "Median Household Income", only show
   the "Median Household Income" graph.
1. Having the dataframe appear below the graph isn't ideal. Create two tabs: one for the graph, and one for the
   dataframe. The Streamlit documentation on tabs is
   [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout/st.tabs).
   
My solution to these exercises is in `solution_app.py`.
